        <p> What you see above you are the total sales numbers for three of the
          five cancelled GM cars over the past three years. <strong>THIS</strong>
          is why GM is closing plants. Those are some stark drops in sales that
          any company should take a peek at and instantly have a fire under
          their trousers. When you are a top automaker in the industry, the cars
          being designed for the everyday layperson should be selling like
          hotcakes. Sure, GM makes solid cars (especially compared to their poor
          reputation from the 80s-90s), but how can an enormous brand like GM
          not have a class leading vehicle? Cadillac, which has also struggled
          as of late, is a perfect example of GM's lag behind the competition
          out there. The CT6, also axed in the announcement, was struggling to
          sell even 1,000 units a month on US soil despite the fact that auto
          critics were generally impressed with the car. This makes one wonder
          if their slew of "just fine" cars is, or ever was, enough to overcome
          GM's simply poor brand reputation as stated earlier. </p>
        <p> The top car on that table, the Chevrolet Cruze, is experiencing the
          worst sales drop of any of the cut vehicles by far; reporting in at
          -27% year over year. My wife, Emily, owns and is generally happy with
          her 2015 model. It has a touchscreen, bluetooth, leather seats, and
          all that jazz; so why are the sales floundering so much given the
          loadouts the Cruze comes with at reasonable prices? Some believe that
          the chickens from 1980s and 1990s General Motors have finally come
          home to roost, and I tend to believe that as well. </p>

         Ask anyone you know that lived during the 1980s and 90s and be rest assured that there
         will be a GM horror story to be told.  One needs to look no further than the
         <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-ten-worst-cars-gm-ever-built-1577414782">Cadillac Cimarron</a>,
         the <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-ten-worst-cars-gm-ever-built-1577414782">Chevette</a>, or the 
         <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-ten-worst-cars-gm-ever-built-1577414782">Pontiac Le Mans</a> 
         to see the business model that Roger Smith, CEO of GM throughout the 80s, had in mind.  
         Combatting the influx of popular japanese sedans like the Honda Accord with cheap to buy rustbuckets
         set a very low expectation and reputation for GM.  This negative brand awareness is something that
         General Motors is <em>very</em> aware of and has had many attempts to correct in the past few years.

         This parody video rather nicely explains how out-of-touch GM still is in reference to recovering
         their reputation to the American car buying audience.  These "real people" are basically describing
         the wish of buying a car that just works properly, something that Chevy and GM should be, but haven't
         always been competent enough to provide.  The bottomline here is if GM is being truthful in restructuring
         in order to invest in future technology for their vehicles (why cancel the Volt, if this is the case?), 
         then those cars better be well-built with a well thought-out PR structure behind them if the American buyers are to be swayed.
