        <p> On November 26, 2018 General Motors announced a significant gash in
          their workforce that could prove disastrous for the North American
          Automotive job market. In a move that will cut 15 percent of its
          54,000 salaried employees in North America as well as put
          approximately 6,700 hourly workers at risk of job loss; General Motors
          is unallocating five plants in North America in 2019. This includes
          assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Canada as well as propulsion
          plants in Maryland and Michigan. Unallocation, or GM electing not to
          send new products to a factory, does not necessarily mean that the
          jobs at those factories are lost. What it <em>does</em> do is make
          bargaining for the <abbr title="United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America">UAW</abbr>
          a lot dicier of a prospect come contract renewal time next year. </p>

        <p> In response, The UAW has filed a "formal objection" to General
          Motors in regards both the plant closings as well as the vehicles
          being nixed from the line that the threatened plants already build.
          Gary Jones, UAW President, issued a statement along with the objection
          on December 3, 2018: </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.mlive.com/auto/index.ssf/2018/12/uaw_files_formal_objection_to.html">
          We have been clear that the UAW will leave no stone unturned and use
          any and all resources available to us regarding the future of these
          plants. Today, we wrote to GM formally objecting to its unilateral
          decision regarding four U.S. manufacturing facilities. </blockquote>
        <p> In justification of this move, GM states that the
          closure/unallocations of these plants will increase cash flow by $6
          billion by the end of 2020. This will help to make GM into a "highly
          agile, resilient, and profitable" with more breathability in its
          ability to invest in new and burgeoning technologies, according to CEO
          and chairman Mary Barra. The AP has reports that these moves will
          ultimately lead to the loss of 14,700 American jobs, including 8,100
          salaried white-collar workers. </p>
        <p> The general reasonings on either side of the political spectrum are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make better cars and this wouldn't be a problem. OR</li>
          <li>The tariffs and tax breaks levied by President Trump and his
            administration did nothing but line the pockets of the rich and
            encourage a shutdown due to prices.</li>
        </ul>
        Like all conundrums such as this, the problems (and their solutions)
        aren't quite as black and white as we would like them to be. Check out
        the other pages for some information about both lines of thinking, and
        make your own conclusions.
