        <p>When looking at the potential catalysts for GM's announcement, it is hard
        to brush off the spectre of the current administrations Tariffs and Tax Breaks.
        Enacted in June 2018, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel and
        a 10% tariff on aluminum; two key components in producing automobiles. In their
        second-quarter earnings report (July 2018), GM stated that even though net income
        attributable to common shareholders increased, commodity costs were about $300 million
        higher than the previous year.  This is a very high increase in expenditures for raw
        materials than GM was counting on when it made its initial profit forecasts for the year.
        This increase, coupled with poor currency exchange-rates with South America, will result
        in a net loss of about $1 Billion dollars on the year.  That's not chump change!
        </p>
        <p>
          During a meeting with investors &amp; shareholders, current CFO Chuck Stevens predicted
          that the losses could become even worse due to the typical three month lag in materials
          pricing.  This means that even though the tariffs on steel and aluminum took effect in June,
          GM (and every other domestic car company) won't truly start feeling the effects until about
          October.  This aligns with the bombshell announcement as it was released in November of 2018.

		  <p>It is easy to see that tariffs, coupled with waning sedan sales (which are being experienced market wide as SUVs and trucks gain popularity) led to this expedited decision.  Imports make up about a third of the 100 million tons of steel used in the United States as well as 60% of the aluminum market.  This makes it especially difficult for automakers who rely heavily upon these industries.</p>
		  <p>
		  On top of the tariffs is the large corporate tax break that companies received in 2018.  Companies taking the vast savings and investing in the American Workforce was a main reasoning behind the tax breaks, but that does not appear to be what is actually happening.  Many economists, as well as CEOs, predicted that a majority of the funds would go towards things like stock buyouts and debt consolidation.  In the same quarterly report that showed the increase in materials cost was the savings of over $150 million in taxes due to the various breaks that the company was given; but rather than reinvest that in the workers it put that into its own coffers.  This makes sense!  Why would a business reinvest with more employees and production when the demand for the vehicles remains the same?
